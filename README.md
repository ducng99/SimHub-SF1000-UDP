# SimHub-to-F12020-UDP
[![Build](https://github.com/ducng99/SimHub-to-F12020-UDP/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/ducng99/SimHub-to-F12020-UDP/actions/workflows/build.yml)

This app primary goal is to add more games support to Thrustmasterâ„¢ SF1000 wheel through its UDP connection. Some data will be modified to accomodate for some bugs the wheel has.

From SimHub app, this plugin will send UDP packets containing data in [F1 2020 format](https://web.archive.org/web/20221127112921/https://forums.codemasters.com/topic/50942-f1-2020-udp-specification/).

The data is fetched from SimHub without any other plugins so it is limited. Some functionalities on the wheel will not be available.

## Installation
- Download [latest SimHub](https://www.simhubdash.com/download-2/)
- Download [latest release](https://github.com/ducng99/SimHub-to-F12020-UDP/releases/latest)
- Extract the .dll file to SimHub folder (where SimHubWPF.exe file is)
- Start SimHub and enable the plugin when prompt (only once)

### Wheel config (firmware v5 and below only)

For firmware v5 and below, you need to configure your wheel to read UDP data. Please read [Thrustmasters guide](https://ts.thrustmaster.com/download/accessories/manuals/SF1000/FWheel_Add-On_Ferrari_SF1000Edition_User_Manual.pdf) on how to set it up.
